# Tropical Cyclone Data Analysis

## Project Description:

This project analyzes tropical cyclone data obtained from the Hugging Face library. It includes visualizations of wind speed over time, scatter plots, and a world map displaying cyclone data. The project aims to provide insights into cyclone patterns and their impact on ocean regions.

## World Map Visualization:

The world map visualization showcases cyclone data across different geographical regions. It highlights areas with higher cyclone frequencies or intensities, aiding in understanding global cyclone patterns and their distribution.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Streamlit
- Plotly
- Pandas
- Hugging Face Library
